# usePopcornMovie - Movie Search and Review Application
usePopcornMovie is a React-based application that allows users to search for movies by fetching data from a movie API based on user input. Users can view movie details, add star ratings based on their reviews, and maintain a personalized list of movies.

### Features
Search movies via an API using user input.\
Display movie details, including title, poster, release year, and synopsis.\
Allow users to add star ratings based on personal reviews.\
Create a list of favorite or reviewed movies.

### Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.\
Prerequisites\
Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:\

Node.js (v14 or higher)\
React\
npm

### Installation

Clone the Repository\
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:\
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/usepopcornmovie.git

### Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project folder:\
cd usepopcornmovie

### Install Dependencies
Install the necessary packages by running:

### npm install
Running the Application\
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

### Start the Development Server
This command will launch the React development environment and serve your frontend UI.\
npm start\
This will load the usePopcornMovie application.

### Usage
Search for Movies: Enter the movie title or keyword in the search bar, and the application will fetch matching movies from the API.\
View Movie Details: Click on any movie from the search results to see more information such as title, release date, and overview.\
Add Star Ratings: Based on your personal review, you can rate each movie using the star rating system.\
Create a Movie List: Add movies to your personalized list of reviewed or favorite movies.

### API Usage
usePopcornMovie uses an external movie API to fetch movie data. You may need to acquire an API key (such as from The Movie Database (TMDb)) and add it to your environment configuration.

### Scripts
npm start: Starts the development server on http://localhost:3000/.\
npm run build: Builds the project for production.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
